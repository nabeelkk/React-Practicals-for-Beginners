# React-Practicals-for-Beginners
Welcome to React Practicals, a beginner-friendly tutorial project that helps you understand the fundamentals of React through hands-on examples and mini projects.

This project covers all essential React concepts like components, props, conditional rendering, list rendering, and hooks — including useState, useEffect, useContext, and more.


🧩 What’s Inside

This project includes:

🔹 5 Mini Projects — small practical examples to apply your learning

🔹 Conditional Rendering — how to display content dynamically

🔹 List Rendering — rendering arrays and lists in React

🔹 Props — passing and using data between components

🔹 React Hooks:

useState

useEffect

useContext

and more basic hooks explained with examples

Each topic is written as a separate component, making it easy to learn and experiment with one concept at a time.


⚙️ Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to set up and run the project locally:

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-practicals.git
```

2️⃣ Navigate to the Project Folder
```bash
cd vite-project
```

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

4️⃣ Run the Project
If the setup is complete, start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```


💡 How It Works
Every topic (like useState, useEffect, or a mini project) is written as a separate React component.
All these components are already imported into App.jsx, but each import line is commented out.

👉 To Run a Specific Topic:
Open App.jsx
Uncomment the import line for the topic you want to run
```bash
// import UseStateExample from './components/UseStateExample'
import ListRendering from './components/ListRendering'
```
Save the file — the app will automatically reload and run that topic.

This allows you to study, edit, and experiment with each practical individually.
